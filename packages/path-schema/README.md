## News

- [2023-02-05](https://github.com/enio-ireland/enio/blob/develop/packages/path-schema/CHANGELOG.md#200-2023-02-05) - First release (beta) :tada:.

## Key Features

Honestly, the API provided by this project is nothing revolutionary.

The key selling points are:

1. **Firebase database** use case and ease of use in mind.
2. **No-frills approach** The API provides a no-frills approach to mapping out your database schema. 
3. You don't have to maintain this code yourself. _Unless you want to (we appreciate volunteers)_ :wink:
4. **Bug-free.** We keep bugs to a minimum by testing the API thoroughly. Published versions of the project have a 100% code coverage guarantee.

<br>

## Status: Beta :alembic:

This project is in "beta" release, which means; it's all new and needs feedback from the community to improve it further. It's all new and mostly solves our use case to map firebase database paths neatly.
